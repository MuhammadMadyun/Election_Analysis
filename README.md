This analysis takes into consideration the total votes, the total votes per county, and the total votes per candidate, the script is only specific to a democratic election. This type of analysis can further be used to increase voter turnout, by adding parameters such as voting dates, time of day and age of voter. The age of the voter may have a correlation with the time of day a voter of a certain age group decides to vote, this can lead to a strategy that will focus voting opportunities where they are needed.
